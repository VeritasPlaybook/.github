# Veritas Playbook

**Practical workflows and systems for knowledge workers**

This is my playbook—tested workflows, frameworks, and guides to help you work smarter. These aren't theories; they're systems I use and refine regularly.

## 💡 Philosophy

These guides focus on:
- **Systems over tools** - Workflows that work regardless of app
- **Practical over perfect** - 80/20 approaches that actually get used  
- **Tested methods** - I use these regularly and update based on results
- **General AI research and applications** - How AI is changing the industry I specialize in (and hopefully what one can do about it***

## 🚀 Who This Is For

- Knowledge workers optimizing workflows
- Professionals navigating career transitions
- Anyone looking to work smarter with AI
- People who value systems thinking
- Compliance/Payments/Anti-fraud folks
